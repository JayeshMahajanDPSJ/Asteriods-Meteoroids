                    Asteroids are smaller than a planet, but they are larger than meteoroids. An asteroid is a small rocky object that orbits the Sun.

               <li>
                A meteor is what happens when a small piece of an asteroid or comet, called a meteoroid, burns up upon entering Earth's atmosphere.

                The asteroid belt is a torus-shaped region in the Solar System, located roughly between the orbits of the planets Jupiter and Mars. It contains a great many solid, irregularly shaped bodies, of many sizes but much smaller than planets, called asteroids.

                <li>
                    It also serves as a sort of dividing line between the inner rocky planets and outer gas giants.

                Meteoroids are also created from impact debris that gets injected into space. The fastest meteoroids can travel up to 94,000 miles per hour. Millions of meteoroids impact the Earth's atmosphere every day.

                    On November 30, 1954, an Alabama woman, Ann Hodges, was struck by a meteorite while taking a nap. The meteorite crashed through the roof of her home in Sylacauga, Alabama, struck a radio, and then hit Hodges on her hip. Today, the 8.5-pound meteorite is on display at the Alabama Museum of Natural History.

                        The April 13, 2029, encounter of Apophis with Earth will be extremely close. At its closest in 2029, Apophis will sweep at about 10% of the Earth-moon distance. That's very close for a space rock over 1,115 ft (340 meters) across!
